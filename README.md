#JRYNES - An Experimental NES Emulator

Feel free to browse this code as you wish. Some of it I wrote in a hurry, so not all
of it is nice and tidy. I tried to keep it as simple as possible, thus I think
it is pretty straightforward to check how it works by checking main.c and following
the code flow from there.

This version only supports mappers 0, 1, 2, and 7, so many games are not playable yet.
Super Mario Bros and Megaman are playable though :)

Use build.sh to build it. You need the SDL library dev packages. I've tested it both 
in Linux and OSX.

Should you need any assistance understanding this code just send me a message!

Have fun!

Juliano
